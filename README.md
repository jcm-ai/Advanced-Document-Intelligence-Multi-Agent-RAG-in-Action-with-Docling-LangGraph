# Advanced Document Intelligence: Multi Agent RAG in Action with Docling LangGraph

In this project, I built a sophisticated question-answering system that makes document comprehension accessible to everyone in our organizationâ€”from researchers analyzing technical papers to legal teams extracting insights from contracts, all without the tedious manual review.

**Imagine having an AI assistant at our fingertips** that can understand complex documents and answer our questions accurately without requiring us to read through hundreds of pages. What if we could simply upload a technical report, legal document, or research paper and get precise answers based on its content? This is the power of combining **multi-agent RAG systems with document intelligence**.

Built a multi-agent RAG document question-answering system using **LangGraph** workflows and **Docling** for document processing. Extract content from PDFs with Docling, implement hybrid retrieval combining BM25 and vector search, and create specialized agents for relevance checking, research, and verification. Integrate with **IBM WatsonX AI** for embeddings and language models to generate accurate answers from documents. Master techniques for document chunking, caching, fact-checking responses, and handling complex questions through coordinated agent interactions.

**Project Overview:**
create an intelligent document processing system that handles the entire question-answering workflow:
1. **Document Processing & Chunking** - Extract text from PDFs and other formats, process into searchable chunks with caching for performance
2. **Hybrid Retrieval System** - Implement a combined keyword-based BM25 and semantic vector search system for optimal document retrieval
3. **Multi-agent Workflow** - Create specialized agents for relevance checking, research, and verification
4. **LangGraph Orchestration** - Coordinate agent interactions with conditional workflows and feedback loops
5. **Error Handling and Reporting** - Implement robust error handling and provide helpful messaging

**Key Highlights:**
- Design effective **document processing pipelines** with caching and deduplication for improved performance
- Build **hybrid retrieval systems** that balance keyword precision with semantic understanding of documents
- Create **specialized AI agents** for different stages of the question-answering process
- Implement **verification mechanisms** to ensure factual accuracy and relevance of answers
- Orchestrate **complex workflows** with conditional branching and feedback loops for advanced question-answering
