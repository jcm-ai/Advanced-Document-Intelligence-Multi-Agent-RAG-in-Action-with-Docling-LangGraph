    "Have you ever struggled to extract precise information from long, complex documents? Whether it’s a research paper, legal contract, technical report, or environmental study, finding the exact details you need can feel overwhelming. That’s where `DocChat` comes in—a `multi-agent RAG` tool designed to help us ask questions about our documents and receive fact-checked, hallucination-free answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure, we could use ChatGPT or DeepSeek to accomplish this task, but when dealing with long documents containing multiple tables, images, and dense text, these models struggle with retrieval and are prone to hallucinations. They often misinterpret tables, miss key data hidden in footnotes, or even fabricate citations—which I will demonstrate below. The problem? These models lack document-aware reasoning and don’t verify their responses against structured sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why DocChat takes a different approach. Instead of relying on a single LLM, it combines multiple AI agents, each with a specific role:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `Hybrid Retriever` that intelligently combines BM25 keyword search and **vector embeddings** to retrieve the most relevant passages.\n",
    "- A `Research Agent` that analyzes the retrieved content and generates an initial response.\n",
    "- A `Verification Agent` that cross-checks the response against the original document to detect hallucinations and flag unsupported claims.\n",
    "- A `Self-Correction Mechanism` that re-runs the research step if any contradictions or unsupported statements are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "This multi-step, verification-driven approach ensures that DocChat provides precise, document-grounded answers, even for complex and long-form documents that general-purpose chatbots struggle with. Whether we need to extract specific data points, summarize sections, compare multiple reports, or analyze tables, DocChat is built to help us navigate our documents with confidence.\n"

    "A [Naïve RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG?utm_source=skills_network&utm_content=in_lab_content_link&utm_id=Lab-DocChat-v1_1738281360) pipeline is often insufficient for handling long, structured documents due to several limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "🔴 Limited query understanding – Naïve RAG processes queries at a single level, failing to break down complex questions into multiple reasoning steps. This results in shallow or incomplete answers when dealing with multi-faceted queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔴 No hallucination detection or error handling – Traditional RAG pipelines lack a verification step. This means that if a response contains hallucinated or incorrect information, there’s no mechanism to detect, correct, or refine the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔴 Inability to handle out-of-scope queries – Without a proper scope-checking mechanism, Naïve RAG may attempt to generate answers even when no relevant information exists, leading to misleading or fabricated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔴 Inefficient multi-document retrieval – When multiple documents are uploaded, a Naïve RAG system might retrieve irrelevant or suboptimal passages, failing to select the most relevant content dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these challenges, DocChat implements a Multi-Agent RAG research system, which introduces intelligent agents to enhance retrieval, reasoning, and verification.\n"

   "source": [
    "### How multi-agent RAG solves these issues?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Scope checking & routing\n",
    "- A Scope-Checking Agent first determines whether the user’s question is relevant to the uploaded documents. If the query is out of scope, DocChat explicitly informs the user instead of generating hallucinated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Dynamic multi-step query processing\n",
    "- For complex queries, an Agent Workflow ensures the question is broken into smaller sub-steps, retrieving the necessary information before synthesizing a complete response.\n",
    "- For example, if a question requires comparing two sections of a document, an agent-based approach recognizes this need, retrieves both parts separately, and constructs a comparative analysis in the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Hybrid retrieval for multi-document contexts\n",
    "- When multiple documents are uploaded, the Hybrid Retriever (BM25 + Vector Search) ensures that the most relevant document(s) are selected dynamically, improving accuracy over traditional retrieval pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Fact verification & self-correction\n",
    "- After an initial response is generated, a Verification Agent cross-checks the output against the retrieved documents.\n",
    "- If any contradictions or unsupported claims are found, the Self-Correction Mechanism refines the answer before presenting it to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Shared global state for context awareness\n",
    "- The Agent Workflow maintains a shared state, allowing each step (retrieval, reasoning, verification) to reference previous interactions and refine responses dynamically.\n",
    "- This enables context-aware follow-up questions, ensuring users can refine their queries without losing track of previous answers.\n"

    "\n",
    "Processing PDFs with complex structures, tables, and intricate layouts requires careful selection of a reliable document parsing tool. Many libraries struggle with accuracy when dealing with nested tables, multi-column formats, or scanned PDFs, often resulting in misaligned text, missing data, or broken layouts.\n",

    "### Why Docling?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Accurate Table & Layout Parsing – Recognizes complex table structures, reading sequences, and multi-column layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Multi-Format Support – Reads and exports documents in Markdown, JSON, PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, HTML, AsciiDoc, and images.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ OCR for Scanned PDFs – Extracts text from scanned documents using optical character recognition (OCR).\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Seamless Integration with LangChain – Enables structured chunking for better retrieval and vector search in ChromaDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Docling parses text?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses `DocumentConverter` to extract structured content.\n",
    "- Converts the PDF into Markdown format.\n",
    "- Splits the extracted content based on headers using `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`.\n",
    "- Prints the full extracted sections for review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docling essentially has a built-in OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capabilities, so it can process PDFs that contain scanned images of text, making it effective for handling historical documents, academic papers, or other non-digitally generated content. Docling is equipped to handle both structured and unstructured PDFs, including scanned documents, making it a far more versatile and reliable tool for text extraction in complex scenarios. This demonstrates Docling’s advantage in working with real-world PDFs, where many documents are scanned rather than digitally created.\n"

LangGraph is particularly useful in RAG and multi-step reasoning, where multiple agents collaborate to refine, verify, and improve responses dynamically.\n",

This step is crucial in the RAG pipeline, ensuring that AI-generated answers are grounded in the provided data.\n",

    "### Key Functions of the Research Agent\n",
    "✅ **Context-Aware Answer Generation** – Produces fact-based responses using retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Structured Prompting** – Ensures the AI model adheres to precise instructions for accurate outputs.\n",

    "✅ **Response Sanitization** – Cleans and formats LLM responses for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Research Agent Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Aggregation**: When provided with relevant document chunks, the agent combines them into a single context string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prompt Construction**: A well-structured prompt is created that includes:\n",
    "  - Clear instructions about answering based only on provided context\n",
    "  - Guidelines for clarity, conciseness, and factuality\n",
    "  - The user's original question\n",
    "  - The aggregated document context\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Invocation**: The prompt is sent to the Meta Llama 3 90B model (via IBM WatsonX), configured with:\n",
    "  - A moderate temperature (0.3) for balance between creativity and determinism\n",
    "  - Appropriate token limits (300) for concise but informative answers\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Response Processing**: The model's response is extracted from the API return value and sanitized to remove unnecessary whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling addresses API failures and unexpected response structures, providing fallback responses when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Result Packaging**: The final answer is returned along with the context used, enabling verification in subsequent steps.\n"

    "## Verification Agent: Validating Answer Accuracy and Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "The `VerificationAgent` is responsible for **fact-checking and validating generated answers** using the retrieved documents. This agent ensures that the AI-generated response is:\n",
    "1. **Supported by factual evidence** from the documents.\n",
    "2. **Free from contradictions** or misinformation.\n",
    "3. **Relevant to the original question.**\n",
    "It interacts with **IBM WatsonX AI** to analyze the relationship between the answer and its source documents, producing a structured verification report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Verification Agent Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Evidence Aggregation**: When provided with an answer and relevant document chunks, the agent combines all document contents into a comprehensive context string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Structured Verification Prompt**: A detailed prompt is created that instructs the model to:\n",
    "  - Compare the answer against the provided context\n",
    "  - Check for factual support (direct or indirect)\n",
    "  - Identify any unsupported claims\n",
    "  - Detect contradictions between the answer and context\n",
    "  - Assess relevance to the question\n",
    "  - Provide any additional explanatory details\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero-Temperature Inference**: The prompt is sent to IBM's Granite 3-8b-instruct model with temperature set to 0.0 for maximum consistency and determinism in verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Response Parsing**: The model's response is parsed into a structured format with specific fields:\n",
    "  - Supported: YES/NO\n",
    "  - Unsupported Claims: List of claims\n",
    "  - Contradictions: List of contradictions\n",
    "  - Relevant: YES/NO\n",
    "  - Additional Details: Explanatory text\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Formatting for Readability**: The structured verification data is formatted into a human-readable report with clear section headers and concise content.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling addresses issues like:\n",
    "  - API failures\n",
    "  - Unexpected response structures\n",
    "  - Empty responses\n",
    "  - Failures in response parsing\n",
    "  - Each providing appropriate fallback verification reports\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Workflow Integration**: The verification report determines whether the answer is trustworthy or if the workflow should cycle back for additional research.\n"

    "## Hybrid retriever: combining BM25 and vector search for optimal document retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RetrieverBuilder` class implements a **hybrid retrieval system** by combining:\n",
    "1. **BM25 (Lexical Search)** – Traditional keyword-based retrieval.\n",
    "2. **Vector Search (Embedding-based)** – Semantic retrieval using embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination enhances the accuracy of RAG by leveraging the strengths of both approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use a hybrid retriever?\n",
    "✅ **Improves Recall** – Captures both exact keyword matches and semantically similar content.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Balances Precision & Relevance** – BM25 retrieves highly precise keyword matches, while vector retrieval finds related concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Handles Misspellings & Variations** – Vector embeddings allow for **fuzzy matching** beyond exact keyword searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Optimized for Multi-Agent Systems** – Ensures robust document retrieval before passing data to AI agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this is essential for RAG?\n",
    "✅ Ensures high-quality document retrieval for multi-agent research workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Improves AI response accuracy by providing both keyword-based and semantic matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Enhances retrieval diversity, ensuring no relevant document is overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "With hybrid retrieval, the system achieves a balance between precision and recall, ensuring AI-generated responses are grounded in the most relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Hybrid Retriever Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding Initialization**: The builder initializes IBM WatsonX embeddings using the Slate-125m English retriever model, configured with specific parameters for token truncation and input text return options.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **BM25 Creation**: When provided with document chunks, the system first creates a BM25 retriever, which uses a probabilistic retrieval model based on term frequency and inverse document frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vector Store Creation**: In parallel, it creates a Chroma vector store with a unique collection name based on the current timestamp, using the initialized WatsonX embeddings to convert document content into vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Vector Retriever Setup**: A retriever is created from the vector store, configured to return the top-k most similar documents (controlled by the VECTOR_SEARCH_K setting).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ensemble Integration**: The BM25 and vector retrievers are combined into an EnsembleRetriever, with customizable weights (controlled by HYBRID_RETRIEVER_WEIGHTS) to balance their contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Weighted Retrieval**: When a query is submitted, both retrievers independently find matching documents, and their results are combined based on the configured weights to produce a final, optimized result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Error Management**: Comprehensive error handling ensures that any failures in the retrieval pipeline are properly logged and reported.\n"

    "## Agent Workflow: Orchestrating the Multi-Agent RAG System\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AgentWorkflow` class serves as the **central orchestrator** of the multi-agent RAG system, leveraging LangGraph for state management and flow control. It coordinates the interactions between specialized agents to process questions, retrieve relevant documents, generate answers, and verify their accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of the Agent Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **State-Based Graph Architecture** – Uses StateGraph to maintain and transition between different states of processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Conditional Branching Logic** – Dynamically determines the next processing step based on agent outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Feedback Loop Mechanism** – Enables answer refinement through verification-driven research iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Error Handling and Recovery** – Provides robust error handling throughout the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Agent Workflow Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Construction**: During initialization, the workflow builds a directed graph with nodes representing different processing steps and edges defining the transitions between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relevance Check**: The workflow begins with the relevance checker determining if the documents can answer the question:\n",
    "  - If relevant (CAN_ANSWER or PARTIAL), proceeds to research\n",
    "  - If irrelevant (NO_MATCH), provides a \"cannot answer\" response\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Research Phase**: If documents are relevant, the research agent generates a draft answer using the retrieved document chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verification Phase**: The verification agent fact-checks the draft answer against the source documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Decision Point**: Based on the verification report:\n",
    "  - If issues are found (unsupported claims or irrelevance), the workflow cycles back to research\n",
    "  - If no issues, the workflow proceeds to completion\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Final State**: The end step prepares the final output containing the verified answer and verification report.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Complete Pipeline**: The `full_pipeline` method ties everything together, initializing the state with the question and retriever, invoking the workflow, and returning the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function | Purpose |\n",
    "|----------|---------|\n",
    "| `__init__()` | Initializes the agents and compiles the workflow graph. |\n",

    "## Example Usage: Running the RAG System\n",
    "\n",
    "The example code demonstrates how to use the document question-answering system in a script or notebook context. This serves as both a practical example for users and a testing mechanism for the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Example Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document and Question Definition**:\n",
    "  - Specifies file paths to documents that will be processed\n",
    "  - Defines a list of questions to be answered about those documents\n",
    "  - In this example, it uses Google's 2024 Environmental Report as the document source\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **System Execution**:\n",
    "  - Calls the main `process_documents_and_answer_questions` function\n",
    "  - Passes the documents and questions as parameters\n",
    "  - The function handles all processing and returns structured results\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result Presentation**:\n",
    "  - Formats and displays the results in a clear, readable format\n",
    "  - For each question, it shows:\n",
    "    - The original question\n",
    "    - The generated answer\n",
    "    - The verification report with fact-checking information\n",
    "  - Uses visual separators to distinguish between different questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern can be easily modified for various use cases:\n",
    "- Processing multiple documents simultaneously\n",
    "- Asking domain-specific questions about technical content\n",
    "- Integrating into larger applications or workflows\n",
    "- Running in batch mode for document analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplicity of the interface belies the sophisticated multi-agent system working underneath, delivering a user-friendly experience for document-based question answering.\n"

      "1. Pandas provides various functions for data frame creation, including `df.mean()`, `df.median()`, `df.min()`, `df.max()`, `df.std()`, `df.sum()`, `df.count()`, and `df.quantile(q)`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Data frames can be merged based on common columns using `pd.merge()` with different merge types, including inner, left, right, and outer merges.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Data frames can be concatenated along rows (vertically) or columns (horizontally) using `pd.concat()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Pandas provides various functions for data frame manipulation, including `df.head(n)`, `df.tail(n)`, `df.info()`, `df.describe()`, `df.shape`, `df.columns`, `df.index`, and `df.dtypes`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Data frames can be subsetted using `df.loc[]` and `df.iloc[]`, and values can be set using `df.loc[]` and `df.iloc[]`.\n",
